# 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
# https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/
#
# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent
# nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in
# the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through
# the root.
#
# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
#
# Example 1: Input: root = [1,2,3] Output: 6 (path: 2 -> 1 -> 3)
# Example 2: Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7] Output: 42 (path: 15 -> 20 -> 7)
#
# Constraints:
# - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
# - -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
