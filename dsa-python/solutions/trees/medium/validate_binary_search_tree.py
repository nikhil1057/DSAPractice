# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
# A valid BST is defined as follows:
# - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
#
# Example 1: Input: root = [2,1,3] Output: true
# Example 2: Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6] Output: false
#   (The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.)
#
# Constraints:
# - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# - -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
