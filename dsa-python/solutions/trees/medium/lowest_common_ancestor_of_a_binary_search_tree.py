# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/
#
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node
# of two given nodes in the BST.
# The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest
# node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be
# a descendant of itself).
#
# Example 1: Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8 Output: 6
# Example 2: Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4 Output: 2
# Example 3: Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1 Output: 2
#
# Constraints:
# - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
# - -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
# - All Node.val are unique.
# - p != q
# - p and q will exist in the BST.
